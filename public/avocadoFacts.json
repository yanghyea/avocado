      "fact": "By brushing the fruit or guacamole with an acidic agent such as lemon, lime, vinegar or even oranges and placing the avocado or dish in an air-tight container in your refrigerator you can help delay this process. Placing the avocado seed in guacamole may help maintain the color of the guacamole because the seed reduces the amount of surface area that is exposed to air (minimizing oxidization). However, it is recommended you cover the guacamole with clear plastic wrap or place it in an air tight container if you prepare in advance and want to store in the refrigerator for a few hours."
